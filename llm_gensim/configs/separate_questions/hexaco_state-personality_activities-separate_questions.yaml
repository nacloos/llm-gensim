      Write a policy to decide which activity to take given the internal state of the agent (state variables are between 0 and 100).
      For each of the activity, write a function that takes the state as input and return the probability of taking the activity. Write down your reasoning first before implementing the function. Be exhaustive in your reasoning. Implement all the activity functions following the format below. Don't write the final the function for the final decision as it is already implemented.

#     You are a helpful assistant.

#     Given the following list of variables describing the agent's internal state, where each variable takes a value between 0 and 100,
#     {states}

#     and the following list of activities (actions that the agent can take),
#     {actions}

#     For each activity, estimate its effect on the agent state variables (the delta to update the value of the variable after taking that activity).
#     Format your final answer as a yaml config where the first level of keys corresponds to activity and second level corresponds to state variables. Use the exact same activity and state variable names as above.

#     Format:
#     ```yaml
#     activity1:
#         state1: delta
#         ...
#     ```

#     where delta is a positive or negative number representing how much the activity changes the state variable.
#     Make sure the activities and state variables in the effects config are present in the two lists above!
#     First reflect and explain your reasoning. Then write your final answers with the format above (has to be valid yaml configs).

#     Write a function to initiate an agent's internal state based on a given personality. The output state should reflect the given personality as closely as possible.
